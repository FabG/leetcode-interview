### 1. Arrays

##### 1.1 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

See [notebook](../notebooks/easy-collection.ipynb)


##### 1.2 Two Sums
Based on this [exercise](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
